they are yet to catch up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you outgrow someone, the things you used to consider edgy, funny, and cute will no longer feel so.

The Guardian checks showed that over 35 million subscribers might be affected if the disconnection move is implemented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the affected operators have between the next 10 and 21 days, starting from yesterday to make amends or risk disconnections, Globacom currently has 41.5 million subscribers; Ntel as at March had about 150,000 subscribers, while millions of voice and data passes through the affected exchanges on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NCC disclosed that at the expiration of 21 days, which started yesterday, Airtel and MTN will cease passing and receiving voice and data traffic through Breeze, Exchange, Solid, Medallion and Niconnx respectively, and will thereafter utilize alternative channels in interconnecting with other network service providers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATCON boss, who urged affected subscribers to use the Mobile Number Portability scheme and port to available network, urged NCC to introduce an automated clearing interconnect scheme as suggested by the association this year, saying the current and future debts may have to be written off, if those companies disconnected eventually go into forced bankruptcy.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px;

Be contented with your salaries and allowances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe government recently increased your general emoluments to make you more efficient and effective in the discharge of your duties. With this increase in your salaries, you have less reason to fall into temptations of financial or other inducements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLet me again reiterate that this administration has zero tolerance for corruption. Corruption is the major reason the Nigerian economy has not developed at the rate of other comparable countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf we must develop and reap the fruits of our democratic dispensation, we must shun corruption at all levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is, therefore, your responsibilities and other anti-corruption agencies to kill corruption before corruption overtakes Nigeria.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While commending the police for the successes they recorded in the fight against various aspects of crime in the country, the President acknowledged that they had worked closely with the military in the fight against Boko Haram in the north-east.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am aware that you have just deployed over 2000 police officers, including special forces to the north-east to support the efforts of the military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe success recorded in the fight against Boko Haram in the north-east cannot be related without mentioning the support you are giving to the military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe group is no longer occupying any Nigerian territory as it used to before the advent of this administration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe recent attacks by the Boko Haram group can be likened to attempts of defeated insurgents to re-organise its ragtag and scattered individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis, however, will not be possible as adequate strategic plans have been put in place in conjunction with our neighbouring countries to completely wipe out the group.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 2019 elections, President Buhari said it is the duty of the police, supported by other security agencies, to adequately secure the elections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201dYou must do everything possible to make the election violence free to avoid ballot box snatching, multiple voting, vote buying on sites, attack on electoral officers and other acts which might negatively impact on the elections and their outcome, \u201d the president said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Buhari warns police: You are not above the law, resist all temptations President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Wudil, Kano state, warned the police against acts that could bring the&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":15039,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[731],"tags":[3522],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/g1545378055.jpg","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15041"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15041"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15041\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15042,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15041\/revisions\/15042"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/15039"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15041"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=15041"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/click9ja.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=15041"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}]
